Agarose gel electrophoresis is a method of gel electrophoresis used in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and clinical chemistry to separate a mixed population of macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of agarose, one of the two main components of agar. The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size (isoelectric focusing agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent), and the DNA and RNA fragments by length.

## Work Experience

> `2015 - 2019`

#### Department of Molecular Biology, University
#### Scientist 
- Agarose gel electrophoresis is a method of gel electrophoresis used in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and clinical chemistry to separate a mixed population 
- Macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of agarose, one of the two main components of agar.
- Managed to not run a single gel
- Identified this equation \\({e}^{i\pi }+1=0\\)


> `2010 - 2015`

#### Department of Biology, University  
#### Postdoc 
- Investigated a ton of different topics, most of which led nowhere.
- Agarose gel is easy to cast, has relatively fewer charged groups, and is particularly suitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories, which accounts for the popularity of its use. 
- Taught undergraduate students.


> `2007 - 2010`

#### Department of Science, University 
#### PhD Student  
- Ran 348 agarose gels
- Agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength, making it suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of DNA and large protein molecules. 
- The agarose polymer contains charged groups, in particular pyruvate and sulphate.[8] These negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of DNA in a process called electroendosmosis (EEO), and can therefore retard the movement of DNA and cause blurring of bands. Higher concentration gels would have higher electroosmotic flow.

## Education


> `2010` 

#### PhD, molecular biology
#### University   
 
- The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis


> `2003`

#### B.S., biology  
#### University  
- Focus on biology and running
