# iA Writer Template for a CV

I made an iA Writer template for my CV. It's only intended for printing or exporting to PDF, so it lacks media quieries to make it responsive. Only tested on MacOS. 

A picture can be inserted and will be right aligned on the page.

The footer html has been changed to include author name and 'current page of total pages'. 

The way I right align the years is a bit hacky, but seems to work.

The font is Source Sans Pro and is embedded in the template. The embedded fonts are licensed under [SIL Open Font License, 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)
